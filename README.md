# Applying Eigenvectors and the Perron-Frobenius Theorem to ranking collegiate football teams
The Perron Frobenius Theorem states that for any square, non-negative matrix there exists a unique largest eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector with strictly positive components. This theorem is widely used to create ranking schemes founded in linear algebra. In NCAA football, rankings are traditionally determined by Associated Pressâ€™s poll rankings, which surveys 62 broadcasters and analysts across the country. A mathematics professor at the University of Utah in 1989 explored mathematical means of using eigenvectors to create an objective ranking scheme isolated of AP polls. My project builds off of this research with python implementations of the schemes within the paper, along with added schemes of my own design implementing modern techniques. Leveraging technological advancements since 1989, I analyzed 47 years of NCAA D1-A football data to evaluate success through multiple metrics both comparing to and against AP poll data. The results show significant and consistent performance improvements over AP poll rankings, with a lowered number of total upsets, and barely half the upsets within the top-25 ranked teams.
